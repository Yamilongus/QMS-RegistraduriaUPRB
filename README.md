The provided code consists of two parts: a client script and a server script. These scripts are designed to create a simple client-server communication system using sockets, where the client has a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using the Tkinter library. The communication involves sending and receiving data related to appointment scheduling.

### Client Script (Client Side):
1. **CSV File Handling Functions:**
   - `wait_for_csv_file(filepath)`: Waits until a CSV file at the specified path is created.
   - `read_csv_data(filepath)`: Reads data from a CSV file, skipping the header row.
   - `update_table(table, data)`: Updates a Tkinter Treeview table with new data.

2. **GUI Setup:**
   - Creates a Tkinter window (`ventana_cliente`) for the client.
   - Configures a Treeview (`tabla_turnos_cliente`) to display appointment data in a tabular form.
   - Configures and starts a client socket that connects to a server at a specified host and port.

3. **Data Refresh and Update:**
   - `refresh_data()`: Periodically reads data from the CSV file and updates the GUI table every 5 seconds.
   - Threading is used to run the data receiving function (`recibir_datos`) in the background to avoid blocking the GUI.

4. **Server Connection:**
   - Connects to the server using a socket.
   - Listens for data from the server and updates the GUI accordingly.

### Server Script (Server Side):
1. **CSV File Handling Functions:**
   - `cargar_turnos()`: Loads appointment data from a CSV file.
   - `guardar_turnos(turnos)`: Saves appointment data to a CSV file.

2. **Server Setup:**
   - Configures a server socket to listen on a specified host and port.
   - Accepts a client connection and starts a thread (`client_handler`) to handle communication with the connected client.

3. **Client Handling:**
   - `client_handler(conn)`: Handles client requests, such as obtaining appointment data.

4. **Client GUI:**
   - Creates a Tkinter window (`root`) for the server with a Treeview to display client information.
   - Starts a thread (`listen_for_updates`) to continuously listen for updates from clients.

5. **Data Validation and Submission (at the end of the script):**
   - Defines functions for validating user entries and submitting data to a CSV file.
   - Creates a Tkinter window (`window`) for user data entry and displays relevant fields for personal and appointment information.

6. **Date Entry and Selection:**
   - Uses a calendar widget (`tkcalendar.Calendar`) for selecting dates.
   - Uses comboboxes for selecting time-related information.

7. **Starts Server:**
   - `start_server()`: Starts the server.

### Notes:
- The client and server communicate using sockets, and the data exchanged is pickled.
- Threading is utilized to handle both client and server activities concurrently.
- The server GUI is focused on displaying information rather than data entry.

Please note that some parts of the code seem to be incomplete or might contain errors (e.g., `__init__` method in the server script and the commented-out code at the end of the server script). Additionally, the client and server scripts are separate entities, and they need to be run independently.
